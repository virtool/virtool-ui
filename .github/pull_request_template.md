## Compatiblity

Any changes that require a newer version of the API are considered breaking
changes.

Common breaking changes:
 - Making a request to a new API endpoint that will return `403` or `404` in older versions of the API.
 - No longer sending request fields required by previous versions of the API 
 - Requiring new fields from an API endpoint that will not be present in
   responses from older versions of the API
 - Breaking backwards compatibility with old response data shapes
