/**
 * Watch the session behind an open SSE connection and call `onRevoked` once it
 * stops verifying.
 *
 * The stream is authenticated once, at the handshake. Without this, a session
 * that stops verifying underneath a connected client would leave the stream up
 * until the client happened to reconnect.
 *
 * This is exactly as sharp as the gate it runs, and no sharper: it catches a
 * deleted session row — including one deleted by an admin-initiated
 * deactivation, password change, or forced reset — and a deactivated user.
 *
 * Returns a function that stops the watch. It is safe to call more than once.
